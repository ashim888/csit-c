####Laboratory works: 
```
This course requires a lot of programming practices. Each topic must be followed by a practical session. Some practical sessions include programming to:
• Create, compile and run simple C programs, handle different data types available in C, perform arithmetic operations in C, perform formatted input and out put operations, perform character input and output operations.
• Perform logical operations, create decision making programs, create loops to repeat task, sue different looping method.
• Create user-defined factions, create recursive functions, work with automatic, global and static variables, create, manipulate arrays and matrices (single and multi-dimensional), work with pointes, dynamically allocate de-allocate storage space during runtime, manipulate strings (character arrays) using various string handling functions.
• Create and use structures and files to keep record of students, employees etc
